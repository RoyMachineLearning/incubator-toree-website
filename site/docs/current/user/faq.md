# FAQ

## How do I access Apache Spark?

You can access Spark through a `SparkContext` which is created by Apache Toree when the kernel starts. You can access
the context through the `sc` variable.

## How do I add a jar?
Jars are added through the `AddJar` magic. You simply need to supply an URL for the jar to be added.

```
%AddJar http://myproject.com/myproject/my.jar
```

For more information about the `AddJar` magic see the [Magic Tutorial Notebook][1].

## How do I add a library/dependency?

Dependencies stored in repositories can be added through the `AddDeps` magic. An example usage would be:

```
%AddDeps my.company artifact-id version
```

If the dependency you are trying to add has transitive dependencies, you can add the `--transitive` flag to add those dependencies as well.
For more information about the `AddDeps` magic see the [Magic Tutorial Notebook][1].

## How do I visualize data?
The most straightforward way to add data visualization with Apache Toree is through the [Jupyter Declarative Widgets][2] project.

## How do I create dashboards with interactive widgets?
Notebooks can be changed into dashboards through the [Jupyter Dashboards][3] project. This project allows you to use 
[Jupyter Declarative Widgets][2] in your dashboards.
